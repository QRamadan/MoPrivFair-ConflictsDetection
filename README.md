# BPMN-based Framework for Detecting Conflicts: A Sub-Framework of the MoPrivFair Methodology

This file presents the artifacts used in Chapter 2 of my PhD thesis, which provides a BPMN-based Framework for Detecting Conflicts between Security, Data-minimization and Fairness Requirements. This framework is a sub-framework of the proposed MoPrivFair methodology in my thesis. My submission includes
a prototypical implementation of my work on top of STS, the supporting
tool for the BPMN extension [SecBPMN2](http://www.secbpmn.disi.unitn.it/), whose security requirements
we reused. The implementation supports: First,
the modeling of security, data-minimization and fairness requirements in BPMN models, using
a suitable model editor. Second, formulating security, data-minimization and fairness requirements as SecBPMN2-Q queries 
that can be verified against security-, data-minimization- and fairness-annotated BPMN model for alignment verification purpose.
Third, automated conflict analysis in data-minimization-, security-, and fairness-annotated BPMN models, 
based on our catalog of anti-patterns.

# Resources

* **Artifact: a healthcare case study and a catalog of domain-independent anti-patterns:** https://github.com/QRamadan/MoPrivFair-ConflictsDetection/blob/master/Telemedicine.exp
* **Artifact: Mirrors of the STS-tool current versions:** http://www.sts-tool.eu/downloads/secbpmn-dm
* **The Experimental Evaluation Artifacts: for transparency we share all our experimental materials:** https://github.com/QRamadan/MoPrivFair-ConflictsDetection/blob/master/ExperimentalArtifacts.zip

## Performing automatic conflicts detection. 
To view and analyze our designed models please follow the instructions:
* Install the STS tools from [here](http://www.sts-tool.eu/downloads/secbpmn-dm) .
* Download the *telemedicine.exp* file from [here](https://github.com/QRamadan/MoPrivFair-ConflictsDetection/blob/master/Telemedicine.exp) to your desktop. This file is automatically generated from the STS tool and it contains all the SecBPMN2 models of our case study.

* To view and modify the models in this file you need to import it into the STS:
 * In the STS tool, do *File→ Import → project → next → select the "telemedicine.exp" file from your desktop*. 
 * The projects contains two SecBPMN2 models namely, "SoSyM19-PaperExample.bpmnl" and Full_annotatedModel.bpmnl". 
 * The project contains a catalog of domain-independent anti-patterns.
 * To run a conflict analysis open the SecBPMN2 model you want to analyze from the following directory: */SoSym19-telemedicine/Models/SecBPMN2/Business process/*
 * In the STS tool, do *Analysis→ Check Security Policy*. 
 * The conflict  analysis will take a few minutes. Once the analysis is finish press *OK*
 * The analysis result will be shown as textual messages in a new window. The messages will be of two types "Error" or "Warning". The former represents  conflict while the later represents potential conflict.
 * To view the anti-patterns find the following directory */SoSyM19-telemedicine/Models/SecBPMN2/Conflicts_Patterns*
